    "### Notes on attention:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Attention is a communication mechanism**\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a set of nodes in a directed graph, where every node has a vector of information, and it gets to aggregate information via a weighted sum from all of the nodes that point to it - where the criteria for aggregation will be based on the data. In our example above, the graph would look like this: \n",
    "- The first token node has an edge to itself. \n",
    "- The second token node has an edge pointing to itself, and an edge from the first token node pointing to it. \n",
    "- The third node has an edge pointing to itself and 2 edges pointing to it: One coming from the first node and one from the second\n",
    "- And so on, until the 8th token node.\n",
    "\n",
    "But in principle, \"attention\" can be applied to any directed graph-like structure similar to this!\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. There is no notion of space**\n",
    "\n",
    "Attention acts over a set of vectors in the graph, without any knowledge of \"where\" each node is in the graph. This is why we use positional encodings! This is a crucial to other mechanisms like a convolution, where it's clear how the filter acts in \"space\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Each example across batch dimension is of course processed completely independently and never \"talk\" to each other**\n",
    "\n",
    "The matrix multiplications happen independly of each other. For our directed graph analogy, this means we have 4 different pools of 8-node directed graphs that only talk to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. In an \"encoder\" attention block just delete the single line that does masking with `tril`, allowing all tokens to communicate. This block here is called a \"decoder\" attention block because it has triangular masking, and is usually used in autoregressive settings, like language modeling.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Future tokens don't talk to past tokens! But if you want to include information from the future and allow nodes to talk to each other (encoder), don't use the masking! \n",
    "- Encoder blocks: All nodes talk to each other. \n",
    "- Decoder blocks: Triangular masking to avoid \"looking at the answer\" when making a prediction!\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. \"self-attention\" just means that the keys, queries and values are produced from the same source X. In \"cross-attention\", the queries still get produced from x, but the keys and values come from some other, external source (e.g. an encoder module)**\n",
    "\n",
    "But in Encoder/Decoder transformers, Keys and Values can come from another source and queries come from X. So it's self-attention if we only look at our set of nodes, but it's cross-attention if we look at other nodes and grab information from them through the key/value vectors. The attention from our example is basically \"self-attention\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**6.\"Scaled\" attention additional divides `weights` by `1/sqrt(head_size)`. This makes it so when input `Q, K` are unit variance, `weights` will be unit variance too and Softmax will stay diffuse and not saturate too much. Illustration below**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The variance of `weights` without scaling will be on the order of `head_size` (in our case, around 16)\n",
    "- But the variance of `weights` with scaling will be 1!\n",
    "\n",
    "This is important because `weights` get fed to softmax, and it is important that it stays \"diffuse\" (not very positive nor very negative numbers in it). *What happens if it contains very positive or very negative numbers?* **It will end up converging to one-hot vectors!**. Which means that every node will only be aggregating information from **a single node**, which is not ideal specially at initialization."
